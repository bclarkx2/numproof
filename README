This LaTeX package provides basic functionality for writing proofs. The format is based
off of the enumerate environment from the enumitem package. Each line is numbered, and 
the package provides several additional tools.

The proof environments in this package are intended to have a spread out, uncompressed 
style. They are not space efficient, but it's up to you to decide if they look nice.

Please see the included .tex and .pdf files for an example.

1. numproof environment

This is the basic proof environment. The first argument dictates the title of the 
proof, and the second optional argument selects the number of the first line label.


2. subproof environment

This environment looks similar to the proof environment, except that it is designed 
to be used nested below a single line of a numproof environment. First parameter is
the root label, and you may optionally provide the character type that will be 
appended to the root label to index the subproof lines. This type defaults to alph*
 e.x: 
	#1 = 7
	#2 = \Alph*

	First line: 	7A
	Second line: 	7B
	Third line: 	7c
	etc...


3. Comments

You may insert a line comment onto the end of any numproof or subproof line using 
the \com or \comline commands. These are right justified. The typical use might be 
to give the name of a theorem you used to derive the current line. \com will insert 
a simple comment. \comline has a second parameter that takes a line number or a 
range of line numbers and inserts a reference to those lines at the end of the 
comment.


4. Notes

The \note command will insert both a footnote at the bottom of the current page and 
a reference to the footnote at the end of the current line. Each additional footnote 
will use a different footnote symbol. The cycle of symbols resets when you make a new 
numproof environment.


5. QED

The final line of a numproof will automatically include a QED box on the right of the 
page.
